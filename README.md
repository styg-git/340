**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

When writing programs, my goal is to maximize functionality while minimizing the amount of code, making the application both time-efficient to develop and easier to maintain. Proper commenting is also a crucial part of creating maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs. I prefer to organize my code into clear sections with header comments, making it easy to quickly locate and update specific functions. To support this structure, I focus on writing modular, reusable code when designing my solutions. For example, when I built my CRUD Python module, I intentionally wrote it in a flexible way so that it could be reused across different projects, rather than needing frequent edits every time requirements changed. Since CRUD operations are common in web development, this module could easily be adapted for use in other applications that work with a MongoDB tech stack.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

The first step I take is to carefully read through the requirements, often reading them twice, with the second pass done slowly to ensure I fully understand what is being asked. The requirements define the outcome the user expects once their problem is solved, so itâ€™s crucial to have a clear grasp from the beginning. From there, I start mapping out the individual functions and data structures needed to meet those requirements. I follow an iterative approach, regularly running my code to catch unexpected issues early. When I encounter bugs, I implement targeted debugging code to systematically isolate problems, allowing me to troubleshoot efficiently without wasting time.

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing and building systems that make data accessible, efficient, and actionable. Our work matters because it creates tools that help organizations make better decisions and operate more effectively. In the case of Grazioso Salvare, the dashboard and database system helps them quickly identify and track dogs for search-and-rescue training, saving time and improving outcomes. By automating and organizing their data, the system allows staff to focus more on training and less on manual recordkeeping.
